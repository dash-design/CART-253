# Variation Jam AKA Goblin and Dungeon Folder

This contains the three variations made as part of the Variation Jam project for CART 253.

## Description

Goblin and Dungeon is a retro-inspired 2D top-down action-adventure game with a roguelite-inspired map generation. Each play through features a unique dungeon layout with a grid-based movement, collectibles, NPCs, and obstacles.

It is a collection of 3 levels built as variations with the same premise. You play as the lone goblin exploring, adventuring, and escaping unknown environments. Tackle the first level and complete all threes consecutively, or play each level as a standalone game.

[Goblin and Dungeon: Explore Level 1](https://dash-design.github.io/CART-253/topics/assignments/variation-jam/variation-jam-1/)
Explore the small world of Goblin and Dungeon through a cozy stroll in the woods.

[Goblin and Dungeon: Adventure in Level 2](https://dash-design.github.io/CART-253/topics/assignments/variation-jam/variation-jam-2/)
Adventure within a fast-paced above-ground dungeon where dangers and friends await.

[Goblin and Dungeon: Escape the Last Level](https://dash-design.github.io/CART-253/topics/assignments/variation-jam/variation-jam-3/)
Escape the dark halls of an underground maze-like dungeon, and complete the Goblin and Dungeon trilogy.
