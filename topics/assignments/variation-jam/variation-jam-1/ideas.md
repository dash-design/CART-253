# game ideas

A 2D platformer where the player control a character that move in a city, discovers different views, and potentialy collect items/coins.

A sky view game where the cursor is used to move in a labyrinthe leaving a trail behind. Maybe the player is a ghost...

A sky view game where the player is a lovecraft character walking in the streets or a dark and scary city.

Tower defense

Side scroller where you are the BBEG that fights the good guys (fairies)

Randomly generated side scroller 

Safe in the dark horror tile based exploration game

Card game roguelike

# An idea

Innsmouth Adventure

A top view platformer where the protagonist explore the streets of Innsmouth, helped only of their lantern.
The player has to walk around trying not to get lost and collect clues/tools/etc. to escape the scary town.
The player can only see what the light of the lantern let them see, carefull there might be dangers in the shadow.

Dangers:
    Holes in the streets
    Angry Fish folks
    Ritual circles
Collectibles:
    Keys
    Flashlight
    Clues
    Notes
Other elements:
    Doors/Doorway
    Water/Sewer
    
# Another idea

Goblin & Adventures

A top view platformer where the player is a little goblin walking around (a forest, a canyon, a cave, etc.).
The player can pick things around the map (mushrooms, wood, gold, etc.).
During their travel they might meet stranges characters (a troll guarding a bridge, a wizard called Tim, a fellow goblin, etc.),
which whom the player might be able to have conversations or simply listen to what they have to say.

With a randomly? generated map on a grid

With objects (trees, mushrooms, gold, etc.) one might pick up

Collecting certain object might unlock dialogues and/or let them finish the level.

First variation = 
    Introduction to our friend and the environment, minor interaction with NPC.

Second variation =
    Enter a new level after completing the first variation.
    Includes more interactions, dialogues, need to collect things to leave the level and go to the next one.

Third variation = 
    After entering the level, things happen...
        Scary music/night sounds. sun goes down/it gets dark. Need to pick up a torch/lantern to see.
    The player needs to go through a labyrinth? or a scary forest filled with creatures, before exiting and getting home safely after such long adventures.
