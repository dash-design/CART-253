## Description

Welcome to my grid-based top-down view kind of game!

You play as a Goblin adventuring through a dungeon, but beware the dangerous killer rabbits!

Use [A][W][S][D] keys to move around, collect keys and escape through the door.

Use [SPACE] to interact with the menus and the NPCs

If needed, meet one of our friendly wizard NPCs, they might help you!

When you succesfully escape the dungeon, try the next level!
