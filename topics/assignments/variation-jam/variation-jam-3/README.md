## Description

Goblin and Dungeon is a retro-inspired 2D top-down action-adventure game with a roguelite-inspired map generation. Each play through features a unique dungeon layout with a grid-based movement, collectibles, NPCs, and obstacles.

It is a collection of 3 levels built as variations with the same premise. You play as the lone goblin exploring, adventuring, and escaping unknown environments. Tackle the first level and complete all threes consecutively, or play each level as a standalone game.

Movements: [A] [W] [S] [D]

In-Game and Menu interactions: [SPACE] and [R]

Here is the third and last level!

[Goblin and Dungeon: Escape the Last Level](https://dash-design.github.io/CART-253/topics/assignments/variation-jam/variation-jam-3/)

Escape the dark halls of an underground maze-like dungeon, and complete the Goblin and Dungeon trilogy.

When you succesfully escape the dungeon, it means you completed Goblin and Dungeon!
