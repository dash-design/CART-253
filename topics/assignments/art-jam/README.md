## Description

This is a view of a pyramid in the middle of a desert, sitting on top of sand dunes. The user uses the mouse to progress or regress through the day. By moving the mouse on the X axis, the sun will move from left to right as if it was rising until nighttime. By doing so, the user changes the brightness of the sun and as a result changes the colours of every element on the screen. It is meant to be a representation of a real day from the point of view of someone observing a pyramid far away.
